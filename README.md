# Major Project: New Wind Farm Connection Design

There is a proposition to connect a 160 MW windfarm to a fictional 132 kV transmission network. This report outlines my design of the entire system, including connection site, transmission components, 
network upgrades and operating conditions.

The code is written in python, comparing each combination of power lines to find the optimal setup. 

In total 630 different combinations of line bundling, conductors, tower types and connection sites were considered. 

All filtering and data post initial computatuion processing was done in excel on the generated CSV file.

This project was a UTAS assessment piece for ENG333 Power Systems 1.
